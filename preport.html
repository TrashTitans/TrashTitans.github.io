            <p><h4 style="text-decoration:underline">Project Overview</h4>
            We are investigating the waste stream of the central dining hall on the main campus of SUNY Alfred State College of Technology. With the intent to devise ways to minimize the food waste that is generated within the Terrace. For a college that has been recognized by national award for outstanding food and style, the unnecessary amount of food waste is concerning. To accomplish this, we’ve been setting up interviews and tracking the transportation of the waste as it moves around campus.

            <h5 style="font-weight:bold;">Coordination</h5>
            <p>
            Finding time to talk to the employees is difficult, as obligations for other classes are taking up most of our time. We can’t ask them during the lunch rush or whenever we get a break because we would end up disrupting their job. We were hoping to narrow down people to interview higher up the hierarchy, as any info they have would be the most valuable to gather.

            <h5 style="font-weight:bold;">Research</h5>
            <p>
            By interviewing a few of the employees at an open house event, we were able to find out that 75% of the food was excessive and mass produced. Leading to excessive amounts of wasted food. Usually, open house events are expected to be the most crowded. If the food was too much in a situation like this, what does this say about day-to-day food production?
